      <description>With the core Standoff application under my belt, I was finally able to move on to the networking portion of the game’s development. I gravitated towards working with network sockets in part due to my background using them at my previous job. The Standoff application never necessitated a complex implementation of networking - a simple buffer of bits suffices to transmit any message between client and server. Messages rarely exceed a byte in size, and only when asked to display a game name of considerable length.</description>
