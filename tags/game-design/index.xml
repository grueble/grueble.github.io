      <description>I wanted to mark this moment as my first major milestone on the way to a completed game.
  Each unique image displayed on screen belongs to a managed game object, with seperate components to handle input, physics, and graphics. In the future, any sound effects or music will be handled by an audio component attached in a similar fashion. The component design pattern was a tip from the Robert Nystrom&amp;rsquo;s Game Programming Patterns.</description>

      <description>I asked Milo Beckman to provide a brief discussion of his design goals for Standoff.
 The original idea for Standoff was to make a game that was cross between chess and a scene in an action movie where a bunch of people are pointing guns at each other.
I was playing a game of chess where no pieces were captured for a very long time, and I thought it was cool how the strategy was oriented around the possibility of capture even though no captures were happening.</description>
